# Dataset preparation

Before running the experiments you need to get the Anonymous Microsoft Web Data dataset here:
https://data.world/uci/anonymous-microsoft-web-data

Create folders datasets/anonymous+microsoft+web+data.
Download the file anonymous-msweb.data.csv, rename it to anonymous-msweb.data and put it inside the folders, so that the resulting path is
datasets/anonymous+microsoft+web+data/anonymous-msweb.data.

# Running the experiments

We recommend running the experiments on a machine with multiple cores.
To create the same graphs as presented in the paper do the following.

1. Prepare the data. Run the following commands:
python3 script_distr_all.py basic <number_of_processes>

python3 script_distr_all.py easysets <number_of_processes>
python3 script_distr_all.py mnist <number_of_processes>
python3 script_distr_all.py msweb <number_of_processes>

python3 script_distr_all.py infliction <number_of_processes>
python3 script_distr_all.py querynum <number_of_processes>

where <number_of_processes> is the number of CPU cores you wish to use.

Running all the scripts will create "data" folder, which is required for the next step.

2. Making plots.
Open plots.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells. The plots will be presented in the notebook itself, as well as saved in the "figs" folder.
